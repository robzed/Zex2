POB's planet data producer - Basic data production Engine**********************************************************	----------------------------	From trading_design.txt	----------------------------	For buy.c to work properly it needs to know a few things about the mothership the player has docked at.	1. The allegiance of the mothership. If an alien mothership then it's likely alien items will be more abundant	and cheaper and the same for human.	2. The supply rating of the mothership - internal mship_supply_rating. A mothership far away from any planets has a lower supply rating than	one directly orbiting a planet. This value is scaled 0 to 100 inclusive.	3. The mothership supply type - internal mship_supply_type. This is scaled 1 to 10 where 1-5 is an agricultural	base for the mothership where 1 is poor agri, 5 is rich agri. 6 to 10 means a tech base where 6 is poor tech, 10 is rich tech.	----------------------------INPUTS======To generate the ratings - POBs uses several different inputs:-1. How far away from the Sun(s). The further away the less energy falls on the planet, and therefore the less likelyhood of a successful people.2. How many moons around planet.More moons = more resource, and more civilisations.3. Is this a Rock moon?Just give a small amount of bonus from (3), for raw materials, but none for large colonies.4. Is this a gas giant planet?Again, as per rock moon - some bonus for raw materials. There may be some air-bourne races, but generally not a lot of impact.5. Civilization size.Effects advancement of culture and technology. Scales from None through Few a hundred to Several hundred billion.This is dependant on planet/moon type, and of 6. Random7. Size=====================CURRENT DATA PRODUCED=====================Mothership supply type----------------------Range: 1 to 10 inclusiveRandom(1 to 10)Mothership supply rating------------------------Overview: Between 0 to 100 inclusiveAverage of near planet supply ratings.Overview: Nearest moon/planet class influences 50 % of this, 25% by nearest in, 25% by nearest outIf other near moons don't exist, then 0 for that slot.Planet supply rating calculation    Type: Integer    Scale: 0-100 inclusive        Random +0-29    Is this a rock moon?
