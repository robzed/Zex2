****These level files are keyword based, so lines can appear anywhere.
****All lines not starting with white space or **** are interpreted. The first 4 characters after <cr> are
****assumed to be the keyword. This is followed by a space and then a list of comma delimited parameters.
****Some keywords, like LAMN have large parameter lists. You would be advised to print out 3d Engine Design
****for reference. 

****Into text for player telling what mission is about, what they have to do and how it ends.

**Monsters can fire? 1=yes, 0=no (Default is yes)

MONF 1


DEST 0,0


****FUEL top,left,bottom,right - specify a refueling rectangle. You can have up to 10 of these fuelling rectangles.
****In this case it's under one of the guns. Zex handles this internally.
****FUEL 5000,17000,4500,17500


**** Now read the objects from their files into the static OCBs
****Not that slots 0-19 are reserved. your objects must be loaded starting at slot 20. they do not have to be loaded
****sequentially.
**** RFIL filename,4 char id,object slot,coll det flag (0=no),4 char texture code (first 4 chars of texture file)
****Zex always reads all the textures present so we don't have to load them manually. Use 0000 for no texture, just 0 won't do.
****Earth mother ship for end of level - fly here to end. Best to have coldet flag off for this as it has a tractor beam(param4=0)
****Note that MS02 must have colldet off

****Now load the monsters from static to dynamic blocks - See "3D Engine Design" for more details and correct params.
****The objects are moved from static to dynamic storage and assigned the parameters you set here.
****The objects are found by the ID (first param) you assigned in RFIL (second param).
