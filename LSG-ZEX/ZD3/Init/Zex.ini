\ LAYOUT OF THIS FILE:
\ Keywords can appear in any order. Keywords are case sensitive. You require
\ at least one space between the number and the command. The number preceeds the
\ command, except in the case of ZRNG. Also some commands have the ON and OFF afterwards. 
\
\ Comment lines are a backslash followed by at least one space. 


\ SRES - screen resolution as follows:
\ 1 = 640*480
\ 2 = 800*600
\ 3 = 832*624
\ 4 = 1024*768
\ 5 = 1152*870
\ 6 = 1280*960
\ 7 = 1280*1024
\ 8 = 1600*1024
\ 9 = 1600*1200
\ 10 =1792*1344
\ 11 =1856*1392
\ 12 =1920*1080
\ 13 =1920*1200
\ 14 =1920*1440

\ WRES - window resolution as follows:
\ 0 = 512*384 <-Not a supported option, but will run
\ 1 = 640*480 <-Not a supported option, but will run
\ 2 = 800*600
\ 3 = 832*624
\ 4 = 1024*768
\ 5 = 1152*870
\ 6 = 1280*1024
\ 11 = 640*400 <-Not a supported option, but will run
\ 12 = 800*500 <-Not a supported option, but will run

\ Normally the same as SRES but if you want a smaller centred window then set this.
\ If you have a voodoo 3 please make sure SRES is the same as WRES. The voodoo 3
\ can only render full screen.

\ OpenGL colour depth - 8,16 or 32 - defaults to 16.
\ 8 will get you the software renderer
32 SDEPTH

\ Use Z-Buffer? - ON or OFF?
zbuffer ON

\ Switch Z buffer on - range in metres
\ For surfaces greater than this range, the Z buffer is not used.
\ Bear in mind this distance affects the resolution of the Z-buffer, so setting it greater may lead to 
\ graphics artifacts
ZRANGE 30000000

\ Z-Buffer Depth in bits; valid values are 16 or 32 bits.
\ 32 bits allows better resolution
\ **WARNING** Changing this to 32 may result in an error if your graphics HW only has a 16 
\ bit z-buffer!
\ default is 16
16 ZDEPTH

\ Should we use low res planets?  ON or OFF (If OFF we use normal res, else lower poly count)
low_res_planets OFF

\ On OS X, should we hide the dock and menu bar? Slower if dock ON
show_dock ON
