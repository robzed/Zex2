RAW Cruncher readme©Lightsoft 98This simple proggy takes a standard LS raw file (i.e. the h and width are specifiedin the first two int16's), and then compresses the file using an 8 bit rle encoder.The compressed file format is:int16, int 16 - width and Height.Then follows the rle compressed tokens in the form of:char length, char colour,char length, char colour,etc.The length token may be anything from 1 to 254.The last token pair in the file is 255,255 and specifies EOF for decoders that have no idea how big the file is (but could work it out from the width and height!).UseRun Cruncher. Select a RAW file. A new file will be created. The new file will be the same name as the input file, but the last three chars will be changed to"RCZ"The creator of the new file will be set to LsZx - i.e. Zex.Zex versions > d8 know that a file ending in RCZ is a compressed file and will do the right things with it.Stu.
